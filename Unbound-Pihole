1. Instructions - Unbound Pi-hole Setup
The instructions that we will be following were taken straight from the Pi-hole website that shows how to configure Unbound. The goal of these instructions is to strip out some of the explanation (though I highly suggest that you read the official documentation if you can) and simply enter the instructions that need to be followed below.

1. Ensure that Pi-hole is installed on your Raspberry Pi. I have a tutorial here that you can quickly follow to get it up and running.

2. Connect to your Raspberry Pi, either via SSH or by plugging it into a monitor with a keyboard and mouse.
3. Run the commands below to install Unbound and attain the root.hints file needed.

sudo apt install unbound
wget https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root -qO- | sudo tee /var/lib/unbound/root.hints
4. Create a file that will force Unbound to only listen for queries from Pi-hole. There are a few other benefits that can be found on the official Unbound page.

sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf
5. Paste the contents below into the file we just created and save.

server:
    # If no logfile is specified, syslog is used
    # logfile: "/var/log/unbound/unbound.log"
    verbosity: 0

    interface: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5335
    do-ip4: yes
    do-udp: yes
    do-tcp: yes

    # May be set to yes if you have IPv6 connectivity
    do-ip6: no

    # You want to leave this to no unless you have *native* IPv6. With 6to4 and
    # Terredo tunnels your web browser should favor IPv4 for the same reasons
    prefer-ip6: no

    # Use this only when you downloaded the list of primary root servers!
    # If you use the default dns-root-data package, unbound will find it automatically
    #root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"

    # Trust glue only if it is within the server's authority
    harden-glue: yes

    # Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if such data is absent, the zone becomes BOGUS
    harden-dnssec-stripped: yes

    # Don't use Capitalization randomization as it known to cause DNSSEC issues sometimes
    # see https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unbound-stubby-or-dnscrypt-proxy/9378 for further details
    use-caps-for-id: no

    # Reduce EDNS reassembly buffer size.
    # Suggested by the unbound man page to reduce fragmentation reassembly problems
    edns-buffer-size: 1472

    # Perform prefetching of close to expired message cache entries
    # This only applies to domains that have been frequently queried
    prefetch: yes

    # One thread should be sufficient, can be increased on beefy machines. In reality for most users running on small networks or on a single machine, it should be unnecessary to seek performance enhancement by increasing num-threads above 1.
    num-threads: 1

    # Ensure kernel buffer is large enough to not lose messages in traffic spikes
    so-rcvbuf: 1m

    # Ensure privacy of local IP ranges
    private-address: 192.168.0.0/16
    private-address: 169.254.0.0/16
    private-address: 172.16.0.0/12
    private-address: 10.0.0.0/8
    private-address: fd00::/8
    private-address: fe80::/10
6. Restart the Unbound server and run the dig command to test DNS resolution. You should see the status as “NOERROR” with an IP address for the pi-hole.net server.

sudo service unbound restart 
dig pi-hole.net @127.0.0.1 -p 5335

7. The final test is to ensure that DNSSEC is working properly. First, if you’re interested in learning what DNSSEC is, this is a great explanation. There are two commands that you can run to ensure that DNSSEC is working properly.

dig sigfail.verteiltesysteme.net @127.0.0.1 -p 5335
This command should return SERVFAIL with NO IP address.

dig sigok.verteiltesysteme.net @127.0.0.1 -p 5335
This command should return NOERROR WITH an IP address. If both are returned properly, DNSSEC is properly working. 

8. The final step is to configure Pi-hole to use our recursive DNS server. Open the Pi-hole admin page, select Settings then DNS. Uncheck all Upstream DNS Servers, check off Custom 1, and add 127.0.0.1#5335 in the textbox. Save the settings.

9. Test to ensure that everything is working as expected and you are fully set up!
